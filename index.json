It can also convert between arbitrary sample rates and resize video on the fly with a high quality polyphase filter. ffmpeg reads from an arbitrary number of input 'files' (which can be regular files, pipes, network streams, grabbing devices, etc.), specified by the -i option, and writes to an arbitrary number of output 'files', which are specified by a plain output url.",
